Python code to setup a windows xp machine

# DISCLAIMER
This is legacy code from early 2009 with some changes to make the code pep8 compatible.

Do **not** expect this code to work our of the box (I can't imagine anyone doing anything on windows xp machines anyway.)


While cleaning up some of my very old backups I come across some very old code. I am uploading it for historical reasons and only as reference code (and also so I can just delete it from my backups :) )
